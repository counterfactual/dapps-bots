 * deployed once. Examples of non-global contracts are the Multisig and
 * the AppInstance contracts.

 * @function linkedBytecode Given bytecode in solc's pre-linkage format (where
 * global contract addresses are replaced with placeholders of the form
 * `__<ContractName>______`; see the description of "placeholder" at
 * https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/contracts.html#libraries), return
 * the linked bytecode after linking with the list of addresses.
