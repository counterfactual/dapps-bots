Node Protocol
=============

Message Format
--------------

Messages in the Node Protocol have the following fields:

- `type: string`
    - Name of the Method or Event that this message represents e.g. "getAppInstances", "install"
- `requestId?: string`
    - Unique ID for a Method request.
    - Only required for Methods. Leave empty for Events.
- `data: { [key: string]: any }`
    - Data payload for this message.
    - See "Result" section of a Method and "Data" section of an Event for details.

Public Methods
--------------

### Method: `getAppInstances`

Returns all app instances currently installed on the Node.

NOTE: This is terrible from a security perspective. In the future this method will be changed or deprecated to fix the security flaw.

Params: None

Result:
- `appInstances:`[`AppInstanceInfo`](#data-type-appinstanceinfo)`[]`
    - All the app instances installed on the Node

### Method: `proposeInstall`

### Method: `proposeInstallVirtual`
