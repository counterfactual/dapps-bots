# [@counterfactual/chain](https://github.com/counterfactual/monorepo/tree/master/packages/chain) <img align="right" src="../../logo.svg" height="80px" />

This package encapsulates the minimum necessary blockchain context that needs to be setup for the `@counterfactual/node` package to function as intended.

This package is primarily for testing purposes (specifically makes it easier to test packages that _consume_ the `Node` package and need the sufficient blockchain context to feed into the `Node`).
