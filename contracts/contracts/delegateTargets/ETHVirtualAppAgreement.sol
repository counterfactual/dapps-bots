/// ETH committed to them via intemediary lock-up instead of having ETH directly
/// committed in a ledger channel.
/// The `target` contract must return via getResolution the outcome of the app
/// with the same asset type as `agreement.terms`. The value of the resolution
/// to the target's first beneficiary (i.e., `resolution.value[0]`) is
/// treated as the amount assigned to our first beneficiary (i.e.,
/// `agreement.beneficiaries[0]`). Note that `terms.limit` is explicitly
/// ignored since limits are enforced by `capitalProvided`.
