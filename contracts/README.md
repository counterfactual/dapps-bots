## Introduction

Counterfactual is a framework for developing applications using state channels. Find out more about what this means below!

## Features

### üì± Multiple Applications

By using state commitments and deterministic addressing, Counterfactual supports the ability to install and uninstall applications within a channel without any on-chain transactions.

### üï∏Ô∏è Channel Networks

Interact with anyone across a network of channels (subject to collateral constraints) and get all the benefits of channelization without having to open a channel with your counterparties.

### üíª Familar Redux-Like API

We expose a redux-like stateless API for application developers. We use native ABIEncoderV2 integration to allow developers to specify their own application data layout.

## Architecture Overview

Counterfactual provides a small and clean API for application developers to program against. It is designed to allow a clean separation of application-specific code written by an app developer and framework written by us. Application-specific code is isolated in a stateless contract. Examples of these contracts can be seen in the repository `cf-apps`.

When disputes occur, an instance of the contract [`StateChannel.sol`](https://github.com/counterfactual/contracts/blob/master/contracts/StateChannel.sol) is placed on chain together with a small amount of state. This contract also manages the dispute flow. Upon resolution of a dispute, apps return a struct called `Transfer.Details` to determine who gets the value-at-stake, and for common types of value-at-stake, the framework enforces a maximum amount of value transferable.

State deposit is stored in a multisig wallet (`MinimumViableMultisig.sol`). Apps are installed by signing commitments from the multisig (`delegateTargets/ConditionalTransfer.sol`). Deterministic addressing for counterfactually instantiated objects is provided through a registry (`Registry.sol`).
