## Architecture Overview

Counterfactual provides a small and clean API for application developers to program against. It is designed to allow a clean separation of application-specific code written by an app developer and framework written by us. Application-specific code is isolated in a stateless contract. Examples of these contracts can be seen in the repository `cf-apps`.

When disputes occur, an instance of the contract [`StateChannel.sol`](./contracts/StateChannel.sol) is placed on chain together with a small amount of state. This contract also manages the dispute flow. Upon resolution of a dispute, apps return a struct called `Transfer.Details` to determine who gets the value-at-stake, and for common types of value-at-stake, the framework enforces a maximum amount of value transferable.

State deposit is stored in a [multisig wallet](./contracts/MinimumViableMultisig.sol). Apps are installed by signing [commitments](./contracts/delegateTargets/ConditionalTransfer.sol) from the multisig. Deterministic addressing for counterfactually instantiated objects is provided through a [registry](./contracts/Registry.sol).

For a more detailed description of contract architecture, please see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
