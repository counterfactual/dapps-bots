/**
 * appInstanceId explanation:
 *
 * When a Node client initiates an `AppInstance` installation proposal, a UUID is
 * generated in the Node to identify this proposed `AppInstance`. To the Node
 * clients, this UUID becomes the ID of the `AppInstance` they proposed to install,
 * hence appInstanceId.
 * This enables the client to immediately get a response from the Node with
 * an ID to use as a handle for the proposed `AppInstance`.
 *
 * When a peer Node receiving this proposal accepts it and installs it, this
 * installation generates the AppInstanceIdentityHash for the app instance as the
 * act of installation updates the state of the channel. The two IDs,
 * appInstanceId and AppInstanceIdentityHash are then globally mapped
 * (i.e. by all participating Nodes) to each other. Any time any clients use the
 * appInstanceId to refer to the `AppInstance`, the Node does a look up
 * for the AppInstanceIdentityHash to get/set any state for that `AppInstance` inside
 * the relevant channel.
 *
