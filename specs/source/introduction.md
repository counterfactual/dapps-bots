# Introduction

Counterfactual is a framework for building off-chain state-channel-based applications. State channels allow users to interact with each other without paying blockchain transaction fees and with instant finality. Channelization is the only technique that securely realises the latter property.

In the protocol, participants exchange cryptographically signed messages which are pre-signed transactions that distribute the blockchain state or perform other tasks necessary for the channel's correct outcome. Next, participants deposit blockchain state into an n-of-n multisignature wallet referenced by the transactions. New cryptographically signed state updates related to the original commitments can now be used to change the state and / or assets controlled by the multisignature wallet.

Through a challenge-response mechanism, on-chain contracts implement methods for participants to ensure that the latest signed valid state update that pertains to their commitment can be submitted to the blockchain, guaranteeing correct outcome of the state for all users adhering to the protocol.

## Framework Design Goals

The Counterfactual framework is still a work in progress.  Its current design (and future roadmap) are driven primarily by the following criteria:

### Minimized on-chain footprint

We don’t want to put anything on the chain that doesn’t need to be. We aim to make a generic multisignature wallet the only necessary on-chain object that needs to be deployed for a new state channel.

### Ease-of-use

We want channels that can be easily incorporated into new applications without the requirement that their developers also be state channel experts. To provide at least one such simple method for developers to utilize within our framework, we provide an abstraction for state-machine-based channel applications, or "Apps". This class of "App" consists of simple stateless contracts which define a state machine, including valid transitions and turn-taking logic. Although state-machine-based "Apps" are an intentionally restricted subset of state channel functionality, they nonetheless enable developers to deploy a wide range of channelized applications without butting up against the often complex and subtle [limitations](#limitations) of state channel design. As the protocol develops further more complex functionality will continue be added, allowing easy utilization of increasingly advanced techniques by developers using the Counterfactual framework.

### Standardized

We want to establish clear standards for how all of these generalized state channels will fit together into a global, multi-blockchain network where any user can easily connect to any other. To achieve this goal, we work closely with great researchers from [Celer](https://celer.network), [Magmo](https://magmo.com), [Ethereum Research](http://eth.sg) and several others. We hope to amplify these efforts to work towards blockchain standards for off-chain channelized applications more broadly.

### Parallel operations

We want to support multiple parallel operations inside of a single channel that do not interfere with each other. We have designed state-machine-based "Apps" to maintain control of the state assigned to them in a fashion completely independent of each other. Typical operations like installing new applications, uninstalling old applications, and updating applications are fully parallelized operations within the protocol.

### Upgradeable

We want to support deploying or upgrading channel designs without requiring the user to make a single on-chain operation. There are multiple techniques which are specifically anticipated in the current design. For the purposes of _trustless_ off-chain upgradability, we are able to support counterfactually instantiated smart contracts as applications. To upgrade a contract trustlessly, state channel participants can simply agree off-chain to a new version of bytecode for their application. At the cost of certain additional trust assumptions, state channel participants could also use an application that is defined using [ZeppelinOS's upgradeable contracts](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/building.html) or a similar method.

### Maximized privacy

We want to achieve a level of privacy where state channel operations are indistinguishable from other common types of on-chain activities. Using a state channel should not reveal any information about the applications that are being used, the state being used within them, or even the fact that a state channel is being used at all. As a first step towards preserving this property, we assume that the on-chain component is a generic multisignature wallet which looks the same as any other multisignature wallet on Ethereum. In the future we expect that stricter levels of privacy will be enabled by various zero knowledge constructions, and that those will fit best when applied in similarly general, abstract ways that fit neatly with this approach.

## Protocol Design Goals

### One round trip communication

The protocol has been optimized to require the minimum number of round trips possible for secure updates to the off-chain state. This has effectively led to the use of multiple transactions being bundled inside a single transaction using the [`MultiSend`](https://github.com/counterfactual/monorepo/blob/master/packages/contracts/contracts/MultiSend.sol) contract built by Gnosis.

The goal of having one round trip for each protocol execution is purely an optimization and "uncompressed" variations do exist that are equally as secure but more costly in communication overhead. This is [currently up for discussion](https://github.com/counterfactual/specs/issues/13).

### Constant sized communication

The number of messages an message sizes for an operation are independent of

- Total number of active off-chain applications
- Total number of inactive off-chain applications
- Total number of sequential state updates to an application

That is to say, the design aims for **parallelizability** in general, ensuring that historical use of the protocol does not impact the size of messages being transmitted on future use of the protocol.

### O(1) response to stale state

It is possible to arrive at a state where any placement of stale state on chain can be responded to with a single transaction of constant size, in particular, independent of number of active or historical apps. This goal is to ensure that any kind of inevitable griefing vectors that are impossible to fully disqualify off-chain are resolvable with the minimum amount of cost to the person being griefed on-chain.
