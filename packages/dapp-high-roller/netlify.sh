# This script file builds the minimum set of local dependencies
# to deploy the High Roller dApp.
# This is necessary because we're using IIFEs and symlinks
# to make the dApp work. This should go away as soon as
# Rollup modules get fixed.
# Also, we're forcing reinstallation of yarn@1.10.1 due to a
# Netlify bug with Lerna monorepos:
# https://github.com/netlify/build-image/issues/196

npm i -g yarn@1.10.1
