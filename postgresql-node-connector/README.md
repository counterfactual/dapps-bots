# [Postgres Node Connector](https://github.com/counterfactual/monorepo/packages/simple-hub-server) <img align="right" src="../../logo.svg" height="80px" />

This package uses the Postgres database to offer an implementation of the Store service that the `@counterfactual/node` uses for data persistence.

Instructions for setting up an instance of Postgres can be found in the [second point of the "Usage" section of the `@counterfactual/simple-hub-server` README.](../simple-hub-server/README.md#Usage)
